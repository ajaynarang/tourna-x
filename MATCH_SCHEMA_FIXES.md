# Match Schema Comprehensive Fixes - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive fixes applied to the match schema and related systems to properly handle doubles/mixed matches and ensure accurate statistics for all players.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Winner Storage for Doubles/Mixed Matches
**Problem:** Single `winnerId` field could not represent team wins in doubles/mixed matches. Only one player got credit for wins.

**Solution:**
- Added `winnerIds: array` - stores all winner IDs (1 for singles, 2 for doubles/mixed)
- Added `winnerTeam: enum` - 'team1' or 'team2' for clear team identification
- Added `team1PlayerIds: array` - [player1Id, player3Id] for efficient querying
- Added `team2PlayerIds: array` - [player2Id, player4Id] for efficient querying

**Files Modified:**
- `packages/schemas/src/index.ts` (lines 163-165, 202-204)

---

### 2. ✅ Missing Player3/Player4 Database Indexes
**Problem:** No indexes for player3Id and player4Id, causing slow queries for doubles players.

**Solution:** Added comprehensive indexes:
```typescript
{ matchType: 1, player3Id: 1 }
{ matchType: 1, player4Id: 1 }
{ player3Id: 1 }
{ player4Id: 1 }
{ team1PlayerIds: 1 }
{ team2PlayerIds: 1 }
{ winnerTeam: 1 }
{ createdBy: 1 }
```

**Files Modified:**
- `packages/schemas/src/index.ts` (lines 551-560)

---

### 3. ✅ Match Queries Excluding Player3/Player4
**Problem:** Player3 and Player4 could not see their own matches.

**Solution:** Updated all match query endpoints to include player3Id and player4Id:

**Files Modified:**
- `apps/frontend/app/api/player/matches/route.ts` - Added player3Id, player4Id to $or query
- `apps/frontend/app/api/practice-matches/route.ts` - Added player3Id, player4Id to playerId filter
- `apps/frontend/app/api/player/stats/route.ts` - Added player3Id, player4Id to match queries

---

### 4. ✅ Practice Match Statistics Not Updated for Player3/Player4
**Problem:** Only player1 and player2 got stats updates; player3 and player4 were completely ignored.

**Solution:** Rewrote `updatePracticeStats()` function to:
- Loop through ALL 4 players (not just 2)
- Use `winnerTeam` to determine if each player won
- Properly identify team membership (team1 = player1+player3, team2 = player2+player4)

**Files Modified:**
- `apps/frontend/app/api/practice-matches/[id]/score/route.ts` (lines 50-140)

---

### 5. ✅ Tournament Statistics Calculation Broken for Player3/Player4
**Problem:** Tournament stats used broken logic trying to check `winnerId === player3Id`, which never worked.

**Solution:**
- Created `isPlayerWinner()` helper function
- Checks if player is in `winnerIds` array
- Falls back to `winnerTeam` check
- Processes ALL 4 players in match statistics

**Files Modified:**
- `apps/frontend/app/api/player-stats/route.ts` (lines 6-19, 111-152)
- `apps/frontend/app/api/player/stats/route.ts` (lines 7-20, 64-119)

---

### 6. ✅ Match Completion Logic Updated
**Problem:** Match completion only set single `winnerId`.

**Solution:** Updated all match completion endpoints to set:
- `winnerTeam` (team1 or team2)
- `winnerIds` (array of all winners)
- `winnerName` (formatted team name for doubles/mixed)

**Files Modified:**
- `apps/frontend/app/api/practice-matches/[id]/score/route.ts` (lines 287-301, 331-345)
- `apps/frontend/app/api/matches/[id]/score/route.ts` (lines 183-226)
- `apps/frontend/app/api/matches/[id]/declare-winner/route.ts` (lines 62-95)

---

### 7. ✅ Fixture Generation Updated
**Problem:** Fixture generation didn't populate team arrays.

**Solution:** Updated both knockout and round-robin generation to:
- Populate `team1PlayerIds` and `team2PlayerIds` arrays
- Update bye logic to use new winner structure
- Set proper `completionType` and `completionReason`

**Files Modified:**
- `apps/frontend/app/api/tournaments/[id]/fixtures/generate/route.ts` (lines 118-149, 247-254)

---

### 8. ✅ Schema Validation Added
**Problem:** No validation for required fields and category-specific requirements.

**Solution:** Added `.superRefine()` validation:
- Tournament matches must have `tournamentId`
- Doubles/mixed must have `player3Id` and `player4Id`
- Singles should NOT have `player3Id` or `player4Id`
- `player1Id` and `player2Id` are now required (not optional)

**Files Modified:**
- `packages/schemas/src/index.ts` (lines 138-139, 249-276)

---

### 9. ✅ Legacy Fields Removed
**Problem:** Deprecated fields cluttering the schema.

**Solution:** Removed:
- `isWalkover` (use `completionType` instead)
- `walkoverReason` (use `completionReason` instead)
- `isManualEntry` (use `completionType = "manual"` instead)

**Files Modified:**
- `packages/schemas/src/index.ts`
- `apps/frontend/app/api/matches/[id]/declare-winner/route.ts`

---

### 10. ✅ Additional Metadata Fields Added
**Problem:** Missing audit and visibility fields.

**Solution:** Added:
- `isPublic: boolean` - For practice match visibility
- `createdBy: ObjectId` - Track who created the match
- `lastModifiedBy: ObjectId` - Track who last updated the match

**Files Modified:**
- `packages/schemas/src/index.ts` (lines 241-245)

---

## Database Migration Notes

Since you're deleting all existing matches, no migration is needed. However, for future reference:

### New Required Fields:
- `player1Id` and `player2Id` are now required
- Doubles/mixed matches require `player3Id` and `player4Id`
- Tournament matches require `tournamentId`

### New Optional Fields:
- `winnerIds: ObjectId[]`
- `winnerTeam: 'team1' | 'team2'`
- `team1PlayerIds: ObjectId[]`
- `team2PlayerIds: ObjectId[]`
- `isPublic: boolean`
- `createdBy: ObjectId`
- `lastModifiedBy: ObjectId`

### Removed Fields:
- `winnerId` (replaced by `winnerIds` and `winnerTeam`)
- `isWalkover` (use `completionType`)
- `walkoverReason` (use `completionReason`)
- `isManualEntry` (use `completionType`)

---

## Testing Checklist

After deploying these changes, test:

1. ✅ Create singles practice match → Verify both players see it
2. ✅ Create doubles practice match → Verify all 4 players see it
3. ✅ Complete doubles match → Verify both winners get stats updated
4. ✅ Complete singles match → Verify winner gets stats
5. ✅ Generate tournament fixtures → Verify team arrays populated
6. ✅ Check player stats API → Verify includes doubles matches
7. ✅ Check tournament stats → Verify all 4 players appear
8. ✅ Test bye matches → Verify proper winner structure
9. ✅ Test walkover → Verify proper completion type

---

## Performance Improvements

With the new indexes, queries for doubles players will be significantly faster:
- Before: Full collection scan for player3/player4 queries
- After: Indexed lookups on player3Id, player4Id, team1PlayerIds, team2PlayerIds

---

## Breaking Changes

⚠️ **API Response Changes:**
- Match objects now have `winnerIds` (array) instead of just `winnerId`
- Match objects now have `winnerTeam` field
- Frontend code may need updates if it directly accesses `winnerId`

---

## Files Modified Summary

### Schema & Types (1 file)
- `packages/schemas/src/index.ts`

### API Routes (9 files)

## Next Steps

1. Delete all existing matches from database
2. Deploy schema changes
3. Test all scenarios in checklist
4. Monitor for any issues with winner display in UI
5. Update any frontend code that directly accesses `winnerId` to use `winnerIds` or `winnerTeam`

---

## Conclusion

All 10 critical issues have been comprehensively fixed. The match schema is now:
- ✅ Accurate for all player types (singles, doubles, mixed)
- ✅ Fast with proper indexes
- ✅ Clean without legacy fields
- ✅ Validated and type-safe
- ✅ Future-proof and maintainable

The system will now correctly track statistics for ALL players in doubles/mixed matches, and player3/player4 will be able to see their matches and get proper credit for wins.
