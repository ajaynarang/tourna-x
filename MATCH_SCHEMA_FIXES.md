# Match Schema Comprehensive Fixes - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive fixes applied to the match schema and related systems to properly handle doubles/mixed matches and ensure accurate statistics for all players.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Winner Storage for Doubles/Mixed Matches
**Problem:** Single `winnerId` field could not represent team wins in doubles/mixed matches. Only one player got credit for wins.

**Solution:**
- Added `winnerIds: array` - stores all winner IDs (1 for singles, 2 for doubles/mixed)
- Added `winnerTeam: enum` - 'team1' or 'team2' for clear team identification
- Added `team1PlayerIds: array` - [player1Id, player3Id] for efficient querying
- Added `team2PlayerIds: array` - [player2Id, player4Id] for efficient querying

**Files Modified:**
- `packages/schemas/src/index.ts` (lines 163-165, 202-204)

---

### 2. ✅ Missing Player3/Player4 Database Indexes
**Problem:** No indexes for player3Id and player4Id, causing slow queries for doubles players.

**Solution:** Added comprehensive indexes:
```typescript
{ matchType: 1, player3Id: 1 }
{ matchType: 1, player4Id: 1 }
{ player3Id: 1 }
{ player4Id: 1 }
{ team1PlayerIds: 1 }
{ team2PlayerIds: 1 }
{ winnerTeam: 1 }
{ createdBy: 1 }
```

**Files Modified:**
- `packages/schemas/src/index.ts` (lines 551-560)

---

### 3. ✅ Match Queries Excluding Player3/Player4
**Problem:** Player3 and Player4 could not see their own matches.

**Solution:** Updated all match query endpoints to include player3Id and player4Id:

**Files Modified:**
- `apps/frontend/app/api/player/matches/route.ts` - Added player3Id, player4Id to $or query
- `apps/frontend/app/api/practice-matches/route.ts` - Added player3Id, player4Id to playerId filter
- `apps/frontend/app/api/player/stats/route.ts` - Added player3Id, player4Id to match queries

---

### 4. ✅ Practice Match Statistics Not Updated for Player3/Player4
**Problem:** Only player1 and player2 got stats updates; player3 and player4 were completely ignored.

**Solution:** Rewrote `updatePracticeStats()` function to:
- Loop through ALL 4 players (not just 2)
- Use `winnerTeam` to determine if each player won
- Properly identify team membership (team1 = player1+player3, team2 = player2+player4)

**Files Modified:**
- `apps/frontend/app/api/practice-matches/[id]/score/route.ts` (lines 50-140)

---

### 5. ✅ Tournament Statistics Calculation Broken for Player3/Player4
**Problem:** Tournament stats used broken logic trying to check `winnerId === player3Id`, which never worked.

**Solution:**
- Created `isPlayerWinner()` helper function
- Checks if player is in `winnerIds` array
- Falls back to `winnerTeam` check
- Processes ALL 4 players in match statistics

**Files Modified:**
- `apps/frontend/app/api/player-stats/route.ts` (lines 6-19, 111-152)
- `apps/frontend/app/api/player/stats/route.ts` (lines 7-20, 64-119)

---

### 6. ✅ Match Completion Logic Updated
**Problem:** Match completion only set single `winnerId`.

**Solution:** Updated all match completion endpoints to set:
- `winnerTeam` (team1 or team2)
- `winnerIds` (array of all winners)
- `winnerName` (formatted team name for doubles/mixed)

**Files Modified:**
- `apps/frontend/app/api/practice-matches/[id]/score/route.ts` (lines 287-301, 331-345)
- `apps/frontend/app/api/matches/[id]/score/route.ts` (lines 183-226)
- `apps/frontend/app/api/matches/[id]/declare-winner/route.ts` (lines 62-95)

---

### 7. ✅ Fixture Generation Updated
**Problem:** Fixture generation didn't populate team arrays.

**Solution:** Updated both knockout and round-robin generation to:
- Populate `team1PlayerIds` and `team2PlayerIds` arrays
- Update bye logic to use new winner structure
- Set proper `completionType` and `completionReason`

**Files Modified:**
- `apps/frontend/app/api/tournaments/[id]/fixtures/generate/route.ts` (lines 118-149, 247-254)

---

### 8. ✅ Schema Validation Added
**Problem:** No validation for required fields and category-specific requirements.

**Solution:** Added `.superRefine()` validation:
- Tournament matches must have `tournamentId`
- Doubles/mixed must have `player3Id` and `player4Id`
- Singles should NOT have `player3Id` or `player4Id`
- `player1Id` and `player2Id` are now required (not optional)

**Files Modified:**
- `packages/schemas/src/index.ts` (lines 138-139, 249-276)

---

### 9. ✅ Legacy Fields Removed
**Problem:** Deprecated fields cluttering the schema.

**Solution:** Removed:
- `isWalkover` (use `completionType` instead)
- `walkoverReason` (use `completionReason` instead)
- `isManualEntry` (use `completionType = "manual"` instead)

**Files Modified:**
- `packages/schemas/src/index.ts`
- `apps/frontend/app/api/matches/[id]/declare-winner/route.ts`

---

### 10. ✅ Additional Metadata Fields Added
**Problem:** Missing audit and visibility fields.

**Solution:** Added:
- `isPublic: boolean` - For practice match visibility
- `createdBy: ObjectId` - Track who created the match
- `lastModifiedBy: ObjectId` - Track who last updated the match

**Files Modified:**
- `packages/schemas/src/index.ts` (lines 241-245)

---

## Database Migration Notes

Since you're deleting all existing matches, no migration is needed. However, for future reference:

### New Required Fields:
- `player1Id` and `player2Id` are now required
- Doubles/mixed matches require `player3Id` and `player4Id`
- Tournament matches require `tournamentId`

### New Optional Fields:
- `winnerIds: ObjectId[]`
- `winnerTeam: 'team1' | 'team2'`
- `team1PlayerIds: ObjectId[]`
- `team2PlayerIds: ObjectId[]`
- `isPublic: boolean`
- `createdBy: ObjectId`
- `lastModifiedBy: ObjectId`

### Removed Fields:
- `winnerId` (replaced by `winnerIds` and `winnerTeam`)
- `isWalkover` (use `completionType`)
- `walkoverReason` (use `completionReason`)
- `isManualEntry` (use `completionType`)

---

## Testing Checklist

After deploying these changes, test:

1. ✅ Create singles practice match → Verify both players see it
2. ✅ Create doubles practice match → Verify all 4 players see it
3. ✅ Complete doubles match → Verify both winners get stats updated
4. ✅ Complete singles match → Verify winner gets stats
5. ✅ Generate tournament fixtures → Verify team arrays populated
6. ✅ Check player stats API → Verify includes doubles matches
7. ✅ Check tournament stats → Verify all 4 players appear
8. ✅ Test bye matches → Verify proper winner structure
9. ✅ Test walkover → Verify proper completion type

---

## Performance Improvements

With the new indexes, queries for doubles players will be significantly faster:
- Before: Full collection scan for player3/player4 queries
- After: Indexed lookups on player3Id, player4Id, team1PlayerIds, team2PlayerIds

---

## Breaking Changes

⚠️ **API Response Changes:**
- Match objects now have `winnerIds` (array) instead of just `winnerId`
- Match objects now have `winnerTeam` field
- Frontend code may need updates if it directly accesses `winnerId`

---

## Conclusion

All 10 critical issues have been comprehensively fixed. The match schema is now:
- ✅ Accurate for all player types (singles, doubles, mixed)
- ✅ Fast with proper indexes
- ✅ Clean without legacy fields
- ✅ Validated and type-safe
- ✅ Future-proof and maintainable

The system will now correctly track statistics for ALL players in doubles/mixed matches, and player3/player4 will be able to see their matches and get proper credit for wins.

## Additional Fixes (Part 2)

### Issue 1: Live Scoring Using Old Schema ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** The live scoring component was still sending `winnerId` instead of the new `winnerTeam` and `winnerIds` structure.

**Solution:**
- Updated `saveMatchResult()` function in `live-scoring.tsx` to send `winnerTeam` instead of `winnerId`
- Updated `/api/matches/[id]/complete` endpoint to accept and process `winnerTeam` structure
- Automatically determines `winnerIds` and `winnerName` based on match category and winning team
- Updates practice stats for all players (including player3/player4)

**Files Modified:**
- `apps/frontend/components/live-scoring.tsx` (lines 163-198)
- `apps/frontend/app/api/matches/[id]/complete/route.ts` (complete rewrite)

**Changes:**
```typescript
// OLD (live-scoring.tsx):
body: JSON.stringify({
  winnerId: winner.id,
  winnerName: winner.name,
  // ...
})

// NEW (live-scoring.tsx):
body: JSON.stringify({
  winnerTeam: finalScore.winner === 'player1' ? 'team1' : 'team2',
  player1GamesWon: finalScore.player1GamesWon,
  player2GamesWon: finalScore.player2GamesWon,
  // ...
})
```

---

### Issue 2: Practice Match Declare Winner Endpoint ✅ CREATED

**Problem:** Practice matches had no way to declare a winner with details like walkover, forfeit, etc. (only tournament matches had this feature).

**Solution:** Created new endpoint `/api/practice-matches/[id]/declare-winner` with full feature parity to tournament matches.

**Features:**
- ✅ Declare winner with completion type (walkover, forfeit, disqualification, manual, retired)
- ✅ Optional completion reason for additional details
- ✅ Optional score entry (can declare winner without scores)
- ✅ Supports singles, doubles, and mixed matches
- ✅ Uses new `winnerTeam` and `winnerIds` structure
- ✅ Updates practice stats for ALL players (including player3/player4)
- ✅ Tracks `lastModifiedBy` for audit trail

**Endpoint Details:**
```typescript
POST /api/practice-matches/[id]/declare-winner

Request Body:
{
  winnerId: string,              // ID of any player on winning team
  reason: string,                // 'walkover' | 'forfeit' | 'disqualification' | 'manual' | 'retired'
  completionReason?: string,     // Optional additional details
  player1Score?: number[],       // Optional: [21, 19, 21]
  player2Score?: number[],       // Optional: [19, 21, 19]
  games?: Array<{                // Optional: detailed game data
    gameNumber: number,
    player1Score: number,
    player2Score: number,
    winner: 'player1' | 'player2'
  }>
}

Response:
{
  success: true,
  message: "Match completed. Winner: Player Name",
  data: {
    matchId: string,
    winnerTeam: 'team1' | 'team2',
    winnerIds: ObjectId[],
    winnerName: string,
    completionType: string
  }
}
```

**Files Created:**
- `apps/frontend/app/api/practice-matches/[id]/declare-winner/route.ts` (new file, 267 lines)

**Usage Examples:**

1. **Declare winner with walkover (no scores):**
```typescript
POST /api/practice-matches/123/declare-winner
{
  winnerId: "player1_id",
  reason: "walkover",
  completionReason: "Opponent did not show up"
}
```

2. **Declare winner with manual score entry:**
```typescript
POST /api/practice-matches/123/declare-winner
{
  winnerId: "player1_id",
  reason: "manual",
  completionReason: "Match played offline",
  player1Score: [21, 19, 21],
  player2Score: [19, 21, 19],
  games: [
    { gameNumber: 1, player1Score: 21, player2Score: 19, winner: "player1" },
    { gameNumber: 2, player1Score: 19, player2Score: 21, winner: "player2" },
    { gameNumber: 3, player1Score: 21, player2Score: 19, winner: "player1" }
  ]
}
```

3. **Declare winner due to injury:**
```typescript
POST /api/practice-matches/123/declare-winner
{
  winnerId: "player1_id",
  reason: "retired",
  completionReason: "Opponent retired due to injury at 15-10 in game 2",
  player1Score: [21, 15],
  player2Score: [19, 10]
}
```
